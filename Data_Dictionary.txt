Objective:

Using raw data available from John Hopkins at https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data a dataset has been constructed for use with BI and analytics tools such as Tableau and PowerBI.
The original data is saved in a wide format most likely to save space which presents a number of issues when loading into BI tools. 
The primary goal of this work is to transform the data to a long format and clean making for easier analysis.
